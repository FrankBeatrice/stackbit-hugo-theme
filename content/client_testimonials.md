Client Review, Juvenile Justice Case: 
     "I was a juvenile entangled in the criminal justice system when I first met Mr. Bondy. I was neither in school nor sure about my future. Mr. Bondy inspired me to pursue an education, despite any perceived hurdles. His guidance and assistance were a critical aspect to my development as a responsible and accountable person. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Bondy. He is a great person, mentor, and friend." 



Client Review, Criminal Case:
    “Joe is not only a spectacular lawyer, he is a truly remarkable person. He took a very personal interest in my case, and was always genuinely concerned about my well being, my family, and my life both as it related to my charges and beyond. He saw me as a person, and wanted to know not just about the circumstances regarding my case, but about who I was, where I came from and where I wanted to go and helped me with more than just my case. Not only did he successfully and appropriately have my charges dismissed, he did it in an honest, genuine manner and has even kept in touch with me since. I have known many lawyers, most as friends and colleagues but have never met one like Mr. Joe Bondy. You can't find a better defense attorney in New York.”



Client Review, Criminal Case:  
    “Joe Bondy is quite possibly the finest criminal defense attorney I have ever encountered, in any way, from any angle. Joe represented me in a way that I had always hoped, but never expected an attorney to, and provided me with a level of dignity, respect and humanity that the criminal justice process often robs from people. Not only was he a superb attorney, achieving literally the most ideal possible outcome from my situation, but he became a personal friend of both mine and my family in the process. Years after the conclusion of my case, I still maintain my contact with Joe on a personal level, and we ask about each others family, what's new in our lives, etc. While Joe believed in me and believed me when almost no one else would, what's most important is that Joe made me feel like he genuinely cared about what happened to me as a person and even a friend, not just a client. In an industry full of seedy, money grubbing, morally bankrupt people, Joe stands out as a true leader, an honest man, an expert in his field and someone who is far above and beyond any of his peers currently practicing criminal law anywhere in the United States. If you have an opportunity to have Joe Bondy represent you, consider it the privilege that it is, and hire him. You won't regret it.” 

Client Review, Criminal Case:
    "Joseph Bondy is one of the best lawyers in New York City. He is very knowledgeable at his job. This man is very intelligent, but most importantly, his is a humble lawyer. He is tremendously helpful and goes to great lengths to help the ones in need. He is well connected in the community, and is well experienced in his field. My family and i are very glad to have such a great lawyer. He has helped us tremendously. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone."

Client Review, Criminal Case: 
    "Mr. Bondy, I am very fortunate to have you representing one of my closest family members. Mr. Bondy changed the life of someone close to me through his dedication, promptness, and hard work in this case. He is a considerate and honest lawyer. Without Joe, the situation would have had a bad ending. He went beyond the call of duty. I will never forget what you did for my family. Not only was Joe concerned about the case he was concerned about the whole family, constantly calling and keeping in touch with everybody. Joe is an exception. He coached me through the most difficult time. Joe has been the most pleasant and fair lawyer I have known. He provided a high level of proficiency and faithfulness throughout the case. Joe has just seen me through a case that was complicated, puzzling, and demanding. He was always kind, concerned, and empathetic. Joe always explained things clearly and patiently so we could make reasoned decisions and comprehend the possible consequences of those decisions. Saying thank you to Joe, it just seems so small for the manner in which he took the case. I would, and will highly recommend your firm to any of my relatives, or anyone else who may need outstanding legal representation. You are the best of the best attorneys you can find in New York."
