Joseph A. Bondy is a criminal defense and corporate cannabis attorney in Manhattan. A graduate of Columbia University and Brooklyn Law School, Mr. Bondy is admitted to practice in New York, the United States District Courts for the Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western Districts of New York, the District of Connecticut, the United States Courts of Appeal for the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits, and the Supreme Court of the United States. Over the past twenty-four years, he has represented more than one thousand individuals at all stages of litigation, including dozens of federal and state cannabis clients. 



    Mr. Bondy has tried cannabis cases to verdict, and won reductions from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for cannabis defendants on multiple occasions. He currently represents a number of companies in the cannabis and industrial hemp industry on a variety of corporate and securities law matters. In May 2019, High Times Magazine identified Mr. Bondy as “one of the nation’s preeminent cannabis attorneys,” while earlier this year, Mr. Bondy won two CBD processing licenses for clients in New York State’s highly competitive application process and a settlement on behalf of a group of cannabis investors. Mr. Bondy is a member of the pro bono legal team in Washington v. Barr, the presently pending lawsuit that is challenging the constitutionality of our federal cannabis laws. His dedicated courtroom advocacy and written work have won numerous clients’ dismissals, acquittals, reduced sentences, and appellate reversals. 


   Mr. Bondy is a life member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), and a life member of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) legal committee. He is the Founder of In the Know 420, a well-known weekly livestream on cannabis law and policy, and Vice-President of the Cannabis Cultural Association (CCA). The American Trial Lawyers College rates Mr. Bondy as one of the top 100 criminal trial attorneys in the United States. Mr. Bondy lectures on a variety of federal criminal and cannabis law topics at various community, bar association and legal programs throughout the country. Mr. Bondy serves on the faculty of Cardozo Law School’s Intensive Trial Advocacy Program (ITAP), and immensely enjoys mentoring young lawyers and advocates.


    Stephanie Schuman is Of Counsel to the Law Offices of Joseph A. Bondy. Admitted to practice law in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, the District of Columbia, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Ms. Schuman is a thorough strategist and aggressive litigator, who does not relent until her client's objectives have been achieved. She began her career at the Innocence Project under the supervision of attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. Ms. Schuman is passionate in her pursuit of freedom for the wrongfully convicted. In 2014, she was recognized for her commitment as the recipient of the IP's Advocate for Justice Award. In addition to her legal work, Ms. Schuman also raised both funds and awareness for the cause through her dedicated work as Co-Chair of the IP's Young Professionals Committee. Vanessa Potkin, Innocence Project, Director of Post-Conviction Litigation, remarks, "Clients love her because she's passionate, knows their cases cold, and gets things done.”



    Ms. Schuman is proud of her criminal defense work, but it is her prior experience in the highly regulated alcohol industry that she believes gives her an edge over many other lawyers practicing cannabis law today. She was instrumental in launching a thriving liquor brand, single-handedly raising a majority of its seed capital, and participating in all aspects of the brand's business development while sitting on its board. Ms. Schuman’s keen understanding of what it takes to launch a company—from initial inception, to early stage funding, to success in the marketplace—well serves her current cannabis clients.

    Ms. Schuman is the founder and principal attorney of Leaf Legal, P.C., one of the nation's first full-service cannabis-only firms, focusing on all aspects of canna-business, including business formation, licensing, regulatory compliance, risk evaluation, intellectual property, land use, and corporate transactions. Counsel to a number of accredited cannabis investors, Ms. Schuman has a perfect record in winning her clients' claims, including against well-known, multi-billion dollar, publicly traded companies.
